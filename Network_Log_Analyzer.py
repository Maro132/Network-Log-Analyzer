**How to get your logs:**
1.  **Access your router's admin panel:** Open a web browser and go to your router's IP (e.g., `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.0.1`). Log in with your router's username and password.
2.  **Find the Logs section:** Look for tabs like "Logs", "System Log", "Security Log", or "Event Log".
3.  **Copy/Download Logs:** Copy the text content or download the log file if your router offers that option. Save it as a `.txt` file.
